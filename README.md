# install-scripts

- Install script for kali to speed up builds.

- Currently using the kali-linux-default metapackage to make sure we're not missing any of the basics, but the idea is to remove that later once I've got the explicit packages sorted out.

- Starts and enables SSH service, no hardening.

- Once hosting is sorted will wget Nessus and Burp stuff.
